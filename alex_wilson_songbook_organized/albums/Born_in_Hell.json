            "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nSixteen summers bleedin' into fall,\nDaddy's shadow stretched across the wall.\nHis words like whiskey, burnin' down my throat,\nKicked me out to wander, wearin' a thin coat.\nPikeville hollers echoed with my shame,\nInnocence a flicker, dyin' in the flame.\n\n(Verse 2)\nFound a floor to sleep on, kindness in a stranger's eye,\nBut the mountain cold seeped in, beneath a starless sky.\nTraded school books for a pick and shovel's weight,\nCoal dust settled on my dreams, sealin' up their fate.\nThis broken arm, a constant ache, a twisted memory,\nOf a boy who used to dream beneath a dogwood tree.\n\n(Chorus)\nCoal dust on the lamb, a stain that won't come clean,\nLost my way back home, a forgotten, faded scene.\nThese coal-stained hands, they hold the weight of sin,\nPrayin' for redemption, hopin' God lets me in.\n\n(Verse 3)\nSunrise paints the mountain ridge, a fiery, bloody hue,\nAnother day of breakin' back, another debt to accrue.\nThe fields stretch out before me, endless rows of green,\nBut all I see is darkness, a fractured, broken scene.\nThis ain't the life I pictured,  beneath the mountain's gaze,\nJust a broken boy, lost in a lonely, hazy maze.\n\n(Bridge)\nMama's hymnals echo, a whisper in the wind,\nA memory of comfort, a peace I can't pretend.\nWill I ever feel that grace again, that gentle, lovin' hand?\nOr am I destined to wander, a ghost in this promised land?\n\n(Chorus)\nCoal dust on the lamb, a stain that won't come clean,\nLost my way back home, a forgotten, faded scene.\nThese coal-stained hands, they hold the weight of sin,\nPrayin' for redemption, hopin' God lets me in.\n\n(Outro)\nLord, have mercy, on this coal-stained soul,\nLead me back to the fold, make me whole. \nMake me whole.",
