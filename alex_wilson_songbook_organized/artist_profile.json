    "lyrics": "Name: Alex Wilson\nAge: 19 (Born: July 12, 2005)\nInstruments: Guitar, Fiddle, Voice, Piano (all self-taught — he's never touched a real piano, only imagines the keys in his mind)\nFavorite musicians: Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Chris Stapleton, Tyler Childers, Adele\nFavorite songs: \"Hurt\" by Johnny Cash, \"Cover Me Up\" by Jason Isbell, \"O Death\" (as sung by Ralph Stanley)\nHeight: 6ft 2\nHometown: Pikeville, Kentucky\nMost Influential Album: \"Traveller\" by Chris Stapleton\nDream Collaborations: Dolly Parton, Reba McEntire, Tyler Childers\nSignature Look: Often shirtless, in worn Wrangler jeans and sun-faded white tees that cling to his frame, finished with scuffed leather boots that have walked miles of hard road\nFavorite item of clothing: A pair of worn Wranglers that he's had through the fields, the mines, heartbreak and pain. Describes them as \"feeling like home\".\nHidden Talent: Can fix and restore broken instruments\nBiggest Fear: Repeating his father's mistakes\nFavourite Place to Write: Sitting on the tailgate of his truck, parked where the pines thin out and the mountain wind whistles\nWorst Injury: Broken arm at 14 when his father went too far — the injury never healed quite right, but he still taught himself to play through the pain\nMost Treasured Possession: The rusted guitar he found at six — still plays it on every track\nView on Fame: \"I ain't chasin' fame — just truth. If folks feel what I felt when I wrote it, that’s enough.\"\nBiography\nAt nineteen, I wear my scars like armour and my past like a shadow—always close, always shaping who I am. My body's been forged by labour and hardship: broad shoulders that taper into a lean, muscular frame, each sinew a testament to the life I've lived. My sun-bronzed skin bears the imprint of too many harsh summers, while calloused hands tell silent stories of work, pain, and persistence.\nMy face turns heads—often twice. A sharply chiselled jawline seems etched from stone, paired with striking steel-blue eyes that shift from icy calm to turbulent oceans depending on my mood. My dark, tousled hair falls effortlessly into place, a rare ease in an otherwise relentless existence. Most days, worn denim and plain white tees cling tight to my chest, hiding beneath simplicity the immense weight of unseen burdens. I walk like someone braced for impact, reflexes primed by a childhood spent dodging fists and insults. My rare smiles hold a quiet defiance, as if daring the world to rob me of one more thing.\nI grew up hidden away in a battered double-wide trailer, rusting silently at the forgotten end of Blackberry Creek Road near Pikeville, Kentucky—coal country. Our home was a steel cage of broken glass and whispered secrets, resting precariously on cinder blocks amid scrubby pines and mountains that watched in silent judgment. Inside, silence was currency, and I learned early how precious words could be.\nBehind those splintered walls, music became my salvation. At six years old, I rescued a cracked and rusted guitar from a roadside dump, smuggling it home beneath my jacket to hide beneath loose floorboards. It became my companion in darkness, strings vibrating with unspoken truths, each note another breath in suffocating silence. When my father passed out, alcohol-soaked and oblivious, I’d coax melodies from beneath battered wood, fingertips raw and bleeding. Music was my only rebellion, my secret strength.\nBy the time I was nine, I was working. Daddy stayed passed out most mornings, and if I wanted food or a way to get to school, I had to earn it. This was poor country—nobody looked twice. I bussed tables, picked crops, washed trailers, anything I could do to keep the lights on. I've always worked. I raised myself, scraped my knees and stitched my pride. Like the song I wrote later put it:\nNo lullabies, no 'good job, son' —\nJust the sound of doors slammin’ when the hard times come.\nThat’s not just a lyric. That’s the sound my childhood made.\nMy musical talent isn't learned—it's lived. Complete songs form vividly in my mind, spilling out fully formed, raw and powerful as storms rolling down the Appalachians. I chase melodies blindly, hands driven by an urgency to release whatever's trapped inside me. It isn't talent as much as it is survival, the lifeline thrown into my solitary ocean of despair. One chorus, more than any other, rides that edge:\nHeard a whisper in the wreckage, ‘neath the coffee grounds and rust, A broken Hallelujah risin’ from the dust.\nThat line comes from a song I wrote about the day I found my first guitar in a dumpster. I didn't find an instrument — I found a voice.\nYet lyrics still spill onto the page, sometimes without melodies to anchor them. Some lines feel like they've always lived in my blood — I carry them through the day like breath. One verse has haunted me since the first time it came to me, just after a particularly long shift down in the mine:\nCoal dust in my lungs, blood on the floor,\nDad’s fists kept time with the slam of the door.\nI didn’t write it — I survived it. That line, that rhythm, it just arrived, fully formed. Songs emerge from the shadows of the mountains, echoing the silent ache within me. of the mountains, echoing the silent ache within me. The hardest one, scribbled in the shaky handwriting of a seven-year-old, is titled simply \"Mommy, Make Him Stop\"—a desperate prayer whispered to the mother I never knew, pleading into emptiness for rescue that never came.\nEvery instrument I touched became an ally. Invisible piano keys danced under my fingertips on kitchen tables, their silent melodies my first real taste of hope. An abandoned violin, salvaged from a roadside dumpster, sang beneath my touch, its broken strings transforming sorrow into something achingly beautiful. Instruments became weapons—each note a shield, each song a battle won against my past.\nMy mother's death at childbirth was my father’s endless ammunition. He wielded guilt like a blade, words sharper than his fists, reminding me constantly of the love I'd supposedly stolen. Welts from his belt marked my skin, but deeper wounds silenced my voice, smothering melodies before they could escape. Yet somehow, beneath bruises and scars, my voice endured—deep and resonant, rugged as mountain rock, touched by gravelly tones reminiscent of Chris Stapleton, Johnny Cash's quiet gravity, and the fiery grit of Travis Tritt. But no one has heard it. I’ve never played a gig, never stood before a mic. My songs are mine alone, scribbled into margins and murmured into silence. Each note carries pain, honesty, and defiance.\nAt sixteen, a fist marked my birthday and eviction notice simultaneously. Cast out with nothing but my instruments and unbroken spirit, I found shelter in another cramped trailer down the road, rented from Mr Jones—barely a home, yet entirely mine. Work was constant: fields, farms, and eventually mines, hands bloodied, knees raw, lungs filled with coal dust. Each dollar earned was another stitch holding my fragmented dreams together.\nI built muscle over trauma, seeking strength as armour against vulnerability. Yet, despite relentless hours in fields and mines, the music persisted—trapped, aching, whispering incessantly from within. That battered guitar, once hidden beneath my childhood fears, now travels openly by my side. It remains my shield, my sword, my deepest truth.\nSomeday soon, I'll summon the courage to let these buried songs free, tearing down the walls I've spent a lifetime constructing. And when that moment comes, the world won’t just hear my music—they'll feel it, raw and powerful, echoing from holler to mountaintop, a voice finally breaking free from silence.",
