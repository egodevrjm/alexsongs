    "lyrics": "Long shadows creep on the valley floor,\nAs the bleeding sky unveils what's in store.\nA cold breath sighs through the hollows deep,\nWhere old dreams stir and new promises keep.\nA shack stands weathered, a whisper of gray,\nBut a tender warmth chases shadows away.\nA soft hymn rises on the morning's chill,\nA silent plea, standing perfectly still.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nBeneath the grit, a spark ignites,\nChasing the ghosts of endless nights.\nThis ain't no Eden, raw and deep,\nBut promises the weary keep.\n(Chorus)\nThese coal dust sunrises, they stain the peaks in gray,\nBut hope's true fire still finds a way, yeah, it always finds a way.\nThe tired earth groans, a haunting, low refrain,\nYet grit-worn hands find strength to rise and live again.\nTo rise and breathe again.\n(Verse 2)\nThe earth gives freely, then demands its toll,\nEach dawn a testament to body and soul.\nRedemption's whisper in the morning's light,\nA bruising struggle, a constant, inner fight.\nA flicker of grace, a beacon in the night,\nA stubborn promise burning ever so bright.\nThe scars remain, a map of every pain,\nBut the spirit's song, a fierce, unbroken strain.\n(Pre-Chorus)\nBeneath the grit, a spark ignites,\nChasing the ghosts of endless nights.\nThis ain't no Eden, raw and deep,\nBut promises the weary keep.\n(Chorus)\nThese coal dust sunrises, they stain the peaks in gray,\nBut hope's true fire still finds a way, yeah, it always finds a way.\nThe tired earth groans, a haunting, low refrain,\nYet grit-worn hands find strength to rise and live again.\nTo rise and breathe again.\n(Bridge)\nThe mountain stands, a titan through the years,\nSwallowing hardship, conquering all fears.\nThis ain't the ending, just a beat in between,\nA chance to reclaim, to heal, to be seen.\n(Chorus)\nThese coal dust sunrises, they stain the peaks in gray,\nBut hope's true fire still finds a way, yeah, it always finds a way.\nThe tired earth groans, a haunting, low refrain,\nYet grit-worn hands find strength to rise and live again.\nTo rise and breathe again.\n(Outro)\nTo rise and breathe again,\nA coal dust sunrise, and we're all risin' again.",
