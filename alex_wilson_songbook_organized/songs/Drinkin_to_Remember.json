    "soundsLike": "This party anthem kicks off with bright acoustic and electric guitars, joined by rolling banjo and a dynamic, screaming fiddle, The full band delivers driving, punchy drums, while raspy vocals command the spotlight, Group harmonies and lively tambourine uplift each chorus for a vibrant, anthemic feel",
