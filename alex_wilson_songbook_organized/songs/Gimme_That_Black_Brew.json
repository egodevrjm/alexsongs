Claps and a foot-stomp pulse add raw, barroom energy, sparking instant singalongs.\n\nFull Recording Version Sound Description:\n\nA jangly acoustic guitar and twangy electric riffs lead a full band with lively drums, a zippy fiddle, and banjo plucks, crafting a polished, radio-ready anthem. Alex’s raspy vocals soar with group harmonies on the hook, backed by tambourine for a vibrant, crowd-pleasing sound.\n",
