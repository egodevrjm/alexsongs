    "lyrics": "**Verse 1**  \nKicked up dust on a road of shattered dreams,  \nWore my heart in patches, frayed at the seams.  \nFell hard in the shadows, where the cold winds howl,  \nBut I clawed my way up, ain’t stayin’ down now.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nGot iron in my soul, forged in fire and pain,  \nEvery scar’s a story, every tear’s a flame.  \nI’m standin’ tall, unbroken, with a heart that’s bold,  \nSingin’ loud, I’m alive, with iron in my soul!  \n\n**Verse 2**  \nBarroom nights taught me how to fight,  \nWhiskey truths burned under neon light.  \nLost love, found grace in a jukebox’s hum,  \nEach note’s a spark for the woman I’ve become.  \n\n**Chorus**  \nGot iron in my soul, forged in fire and pain,  \nEvery scar’s a story, every tear’s a flame.  \nI’m standin’ tall, unbroken, with a heart that’s bold,  \nSingin’ loud, I’m alive, with iron in my soul!  \n\n**Bridge**  \nThey tried to bend me, tried to break my stride,  \nBut my roots run deeper than their whispered lies.  \nWith a voice like thunder, I’ll shake the ground,  \nThis iron heart’s the sweetest sound!  \n\n**Chorus**  \nGot iron in my soul, forged in fire and pain,  \nEvery scar’s a story, every tear’s a flame.  \nI’m standin’ tall, unbroken, with a heart that’s bold,  \nSingin’ loud, I’m alive, with iron in my soul!  \n\n**Outro**  \n(Claps, guitar swell)  \nIron in my soul, it’ll never rust away,  \nCarved my name in the stars, here to stay.",
    "soundsLike": "A blend of twangy electric and rich acoustic guitars drives the anthem, tight with full band energy, pounding drums, and soulful fiddle lines weaving throughout, Warm organ pads fill out the mix, Powerful female vocals with reverb and layered harmonies create a dynamic, crowd-energizing hook",
