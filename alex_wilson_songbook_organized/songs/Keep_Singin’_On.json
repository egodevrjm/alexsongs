His gravelly vocals carry a warm, steady cadence, rising in the chorus with a hopeful lift, the song’s intimacy suiting a garage jam for Maria.\nFull Studio: A clean acoustic guitar leads, backed by a gentle kick drum, upright bass, and subtle fiddle fills. Maria’s vocals (imagined as rich and soulful) soar with reverb, harmonies in the chorus, and a mandolin adding sparkle, creating a polished yet rootsy country track.\n",
