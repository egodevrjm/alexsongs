    "lyrics": "The jar gets passed 'round a hickory fire,\nSingin' off-key with a backwoods choir.\nThat white lightnin' hits you, clears out the doubt,\nMakes a fella feel what the preachin's all about.\nWe're hollerin' stories the pines have all heard,\nSlurrin' every syllable of every other word,\nAnd the moon hangs above us like a holy host,\nGivin' its blessin' to the sinners who drink the most.\n\nThen the sun comes crawlin' up the eastern ridge,\nMy head's still poundin' on a rickety bridge.\nGot the taste of charcoal still stuck on my tongue,\nFeel a hundred years older than when the night was young.\nThat's when I hear it, from the valley down below,\nA sound that's meant to save you, but it rings so slow…\nFirst Baptist sendin' out its Sunday sound,\nWhile we're still tryin' to bury the evidence in the ground.\n\nIt's moonshine and church bells, a holy kind of beat,\nOne saves your soul, the other saves your feet… from the cold.\nIt's Saturday's fire and Sunday's golden rule,\nMakin' a good-timin', hymn-singin', Appalachian fool.\nLord have mercy, I know just where I stand—\nWith a foot in the creek bed and one in the promised land.\n\nI see ol' man Hemphill, who bought a quart last night,\nHidin' in the back pew, lookin' for the light.\nHis wife is fannin' furious, singin' *Rock of Ages*,\nWhile he's sweatin' out the devil from last night's rages.\nThe preacher's talkin' brimstone, talkin' 'bout the fall,\nAnd I reckon half the congregation can't remember it at all,\n'Cause we were all there howlin', united in our sin,\nNow we're all here prayin' they might just let us in.\n\nI ain't makin' fun, I'm just tellin' what is true,\nThe good Lord made the corn grow, and the yeast to help it through.\nHe made the fiddle scream and the organ whisper low,\nMaybe one's for gettin' ready and the other's for the show.\nIt’s a complicated rhythm for a simple man.\n\nIt's moonshine and church bells, a holy kind of beat,\nOne saves your soul, the other saves your feet… from the cold.\nIt's Saturday's fire and Sunday's golden rule,\nMakin' a good-timin', hymn-singin', Appalachian fool.\nLord have mercy, I know just where I stand—\nWith a foot in the creek bed and one in the promised land.\n\nYeah, the promised land...\nRinging in my ears now...\nDon't know which is which.",
    "soundsLike": "A relentless rush of Appalachian bluegrass energy, propelled by driving acoustic guitar and punchy upright bass, Banjo fires rapid syncopations, fiddle lets loose with high, piercing leads, while tightly punctuated mandolin chords add punch, Gritty baritone vocals cut through confidently. Real crossover potential due to the near rap-like verses.",
