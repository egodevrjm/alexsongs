    "lyrics": "(Verse 1) The timbers cracked like a sinner's bones\nEight hundred feet of Kentucky stone\nHeard the mountain groan and give a sigh\nAnd seal us off from a patch of sky\nOld Man Miller, he started to pray\nAsked for 'Grace' to light the way\nWell, this old guitar's all I got to give\nSo hush now, brothers… while we live.\n\n(Chorus) This ain’t no church, no steeple grand\nJust coal-black dust on a tremblin’ hand\nBut we’ll find a hymn beneath the seam\nIn the diesel smoke and the dyin’ beam\nLet the mountain have its heavy say\nWe’ll sing it down till the light of day\nY’all just breathe in slow, and understand\nWe're holdin' on 'gainst the mountain's heavy hand.\n\n(Verse 2) I see your faces, etched in fear\nTaste the iron in the thinnin' air\nReminds me of a different kind of dark\nA different rage that left its mark\nBut down here, boys, we’re all the same\nJust souls callin' out a different name\nFrom a place that taught us how to bleed\nAnd plant our hope like a mustard seed.\n\n(Chorus) 'Cause this ain’t no church, no steeple grand\nJust coal-black dust on a tremblin’ hand\nBut we’ll find a hymn beneath the seam\nIn the diesel smoke and the dyin’ beam\nLet the mountain have its heavy say\nWe’ll sing it down till the light of day\nY’all just breathe in slow, and understand\nWe're holdin' on 'gainst the mountain's heavy hand.\n\n(Bridge) Lord, if you're listenin' through the rock and the slate\nI ain't askin' you to change our fate\nJust let this worn-out six-string ring\nAnd give these tired lungs one more song to sing\nA broken chord, a sinner's grace\nFor every shadow in this place…\n\n(Outro) The mountain's heavy hand…\nJust breathe it in… breathe it low…\nBreathe it out… let the darkness know…\n…we’re still here.",
    "soundsLike": "The song opens with slow, resonant 4/4 time; delicate fingerpicked guitar, understated bass, and soft percussion create an intimate verse texture, The chorus erupts with forceful strummed guitar, bold drums, deep swelling bass, and warm atmospheric pads, amplifying a somber yet defiant mood",
