The bridge and outro would feature slightly more intricate fingerstyle.\n\nSounds like Recording: A warm, intimate studio recording with acoustic guitar as the foundation, layered with subtle strings, piano, and light percussion.  The production emphasizes the vulnerability of the vocals and builds to a powerful, yet restrained, chorus.\n\n",
