    "lyrics": "(Classic Country Standard)\nVerse 1\nI’ve roamed the wide plains where the wild winds call,\nChased dreams ‘cross canyons, watched the mighty fall.\nBut your gentle touch stopped this drifter’s heart,\nShowed me a horizon where forever could start.\nNo lonesome trail could pull me away,\n‘Cause darlin’, I learned that sometimes cowboys stay.\nChorus\nWe don’t ride off into sunsets alone —\nSome of us plant our boots and build a home.\nWith every nail, with every prayer,\nWe carve a life from the love we share.\nThrough storms and years, come what may,\nI’m yours, my love, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.\nVerse 2\nThe old songs sing of the wanderer’s road,\nA heart unbound, carryin’ a lonesome load.\nBut I found my freedom in the vows we made,\nIn the porch we built and the plans we laid.\nYour hand in mine is my promised land,\nA stronger call than the open sand.\nChorus\nWe don’t ride off into sunsets alone —\nSome of us plant our boots and build a home.\nWith every nail, with every prayer,\nWe carve a life from the love we share.\nThrough storms and years, come what may,\nI’m yours, my love, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.\nBridge\nLet the world keep spinnin’, let the rivers run,\nWe’ll raise our babies ‘neath this prairie sun.\nNo fence can hold us, but we choose to stand,\nRooted together on this sacred land.\nEvery scar, every laugh, every tear we’ve known,\nProves a cowboy’s heart can call one place home.\nChorus\nWe don’t ride off into sunsets alone —\nSome of us plant our boots and build a home.\nWith every nail, with every prayer,\nWe carve a life from the love we share.\nThrough storms and years, come what may,\nI’m yours, my love, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.\nVerse 3\nWhen the years have silvered your hair and mine,\nWhen the stars look down on this life divine,\nI’ll still be here, by your side I’ll stand,\nHoldin’ the heart that still holds my hand.\nFrom our first dance to our final day,\nI’ll love you, darlin’, ‘cause cowboys stay.\nFinal Chorus\nWe don’t ride off into sunsets alone —\nSome of us plant our boots and build a home.\nWith every nail, with every prayer,\nWe carve a life from the love we share.\nThrough storms and years, come what may,\nI’m yours, my love, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.\nOutro\nYeah, through storms and years, come what may,\nMy heart’s right here, ‘cause sometimes cowboys stay.\nThis song is designed to be a country standard, with a timeless melody (imagined in the vein of a waltz or slow ballad) and lyrics that resonate across generations.",
