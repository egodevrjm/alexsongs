Claps and a foot-tap pulse add raw, kitchen-jam energy, sparking singalongs.\n\nFull Recording Version Sound Description:\n\nA jangly acoustic guitar and soulful electric riffs lead a full band with upbeat drums, a lively piano, and gospel choir harmonies, crafting a polished, radio-ready anthem. Alex’s raspy vocals soar with reverb on the hook, backed by tambourine for a vibrant, crowd-pleasing sound.\n",
