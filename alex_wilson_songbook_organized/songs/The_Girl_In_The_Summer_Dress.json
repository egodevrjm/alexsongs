Think bluesy rock with a touch of swagger.\n\n**Verse 1:**  Start smooth, almost conversational. Build intensity as the verse progresses, culminating in a powerful delivery of \"owned that space.\"\n\n**Chorus:**  Explosive energy.  \"Sparks flew free\" should feel electric.  Emphasize the playful danger of \"pure trouble.\"\n\n**Verse 2:**  Maintain energy, but inject a more intimate, sensual tone.  Focus on the tactile imagery: \"velvet,\" \"fire,\" \"graze.\"\n\n**Bridge:**  Slightly more reflective, but still charged with the lingering energy of the encounter.  \"Mischievous glint\" should have a knowing smile behind it.\n\n**Final Chorus:**  Similar to previous choruses, but with a final surge of energy and admiration.  \"God, she was bold\" should be delivered with a mix of awe and respect.\n\n**Vocal Delivery:**  Slightly raspy, with a hint of bluesy grit.  Play with dynamics, contrasting smooth, intimate moments with bursts of raw energy.\n\n**Instrumentation:**  Driving rhythm section, punctuated by bluesy guitar riffs.  Consider adding a touch of harmonica or saxophone for extra flavor.\n\n\n### Sounds Like\n\nSounds like Acoustic:  Fingerpicked acoustic guitar, upright bass, and light brushed drums create a warm, intimate feel with a touch of bluesy swagger.\n\nSounds like Recording:  A polished, roots-rock production with electric guitars, driving drums, and possibly some organ or harmonica, creating a vibrant and energetic sound. \n\n",
