    "notes": "This song fragment centers on the redemptive power of music amidst hardship.  The stark imagery of poverty (\"coal dust sings,\" \"broke-down things,\" \"trailer's shadow\") and abuse (\"father's fist\") establishes a bleak backdrop.  The guitar becomes a refuge, a \"salvation,\" its \"six-string's kiss\" contrasting the harshness of reality.  Secrecy and fear are conveyed through hiding the instrument and playing despite bleeding fingers. The chorus elevates music to a spiritual level – a \"gospel\" found when the world's noise drowns out prayer, suggesting music as a form of solace and self-expression when other avenues are unavailable.  The emotional journey moves from despair and suppression to finding strength and voice through music.",

    "lyrics": "Verse 1\nI was born in a holler where the coal dust sings,\nRaised on the ache of broke-down things.\nA trailer’s shadow, a father’s fist,\nFound my salvation in a six-string’s kiss.\nHid that guitar where the floorboards creak,\nPlayed ‘til my fingers bled, too scared to speak.\nChorus\nWhen the world talks too loud for a man to pray,\nI find my gospel in the strings I play.\nSound: fall like rain on a dust-dry field—\nThe music finds the parts I forgot to heal.\nIt’s my shield, my soul, my unbroken truth,\nThe music carries me when I’m black and blue.\nVerse 2\nFound a fiddle in a dumpster, strings half-dead,\nTaught it to cry for the dreams in my head.\nPiano keys I traced on a tabletop worn,\nBuilt me a hymn where my heart was torn.\nEvery scar’s a chord, every bruise a rhyme,\nMusic’s the only thing that’s mine all the time.\nChorus\nWhen the world talks too loud for a man to pray,\nI find my gospel in the strings I play.\nSound: fall like rain on a dust-dry field—\nThe music finds the parts I forgot to heal.\nIt’s my shield, my soul, my unbroken truth,\nThe music carries me when I’m black and blue.\nBridge\nWhen the bottle’s empty and the night’s too long,\nWhen love turns to lies and the road feels wrong,\nI don’t need a preacher, don’t need a sign—\nJust a battered Martin and a melody line.\nIt pulls me through the dark, it speaks my name,\nTurns my silence to a holy flame.\nVerse 3\nNow I’m runnin’ on roads where the maps don’t go,\nChasin’ a sound only my heart knows.\nStrangers hear my voice, they feel my pain,\nSay it’s like thunder callin’ down the rain.\nBut it ain’t for them, it’s for the boy I was—\nWho found his freedom in a guitar’s buzz.\nFinal Chorus\nWhen the world talks too loud for a man to pray,\nI find my gospel in the strings I play.\nSound: fall like rain on a dust-dry field—\nThe music finds the parts I forgot to heal.\nIt’s my shield, my soul, my unbroken truth,\nThe music carries me when I’m black and blue.\nOutro\nSo let the world keep screamin’, let the shadows fall,\nThe music’s my answer, my only call.\nFrom a trailer’s ruin to a stage unknown,\nThe music’s the fire that brings me home.",
