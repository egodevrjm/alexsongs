    "lyrics": "Verse 1:\nBorn in the shadow of a rusted cage,\nCoal dust scars and a heart’s old rage.\nWords stayed locked where the hurt runs deep,\nWhispers in the dark were mine to keep.\nChorus:\nYou gotta walk through silence to sing the truth,\nFeel the ache in your bones, let it carve your youth.\nEvery scar’s a note, every wound’s a song,\nThrough the silence, I found where I belong.\nVerse 2:\nNights on the mountain, just me and the wind,\nStrummed my pain where the pines don’t end.\nEach string I broke was a chain let go,\nTruth came alive where the quiet grows.\nChorus:\nYou gotta walk through silence to sing the truth,\nFeel the ache in your bones, let it carve your youth.\nEvery scar’s a note, every wound’s a song,\nThrough the silence, I found where I belong.\nBridge:\nNo crowd, no stage, just a heart laid bare,\nSang to the stars ‘cause they always cared.\nThe hurt runs deep, but the truth runs free,\nSilence taught the song that’s savin’ me.\nChorus:\nYou gotta walk through silence to sing the truth,\nFeel the ache in your bones, let it carve your youth.\nEvery scar’s a note, every wound’s a song,\nThrough the silence, I found where I belong.\nOutro:\nNow I sing my truth, let the echoes fly,\nBorn in the silence ‘neath a Kentucky sky.\nYou gotta walk through silence, let it break you loose,\nTo find the song that’s livin’ in your truth.",
