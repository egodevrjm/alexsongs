    "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nCreek water whisperin' secrets low,\n'Bout the mountain's wisdom, slow and slow.\nHemlock shadows stretchin' long and deep,\nPeace in the silence, secrets to keep.\nCampfire light a-flickerin' in the night,\nStars above, burnin' ever so bright.\n(Chorus)\nOld man mountain, he don't speak a word,\nBut lessons learned, ain't never heard\nIn no dusty book or preacher's plea,\nJust the wind's sigh in the old oak tree.\nTruth ain't found in the city's glare,\nIt's here in the hollers, hangin' in the air.\n(Verse 2)\nDaddy's anger, a thunderin' storm,\nLeft scars deeper than any coal mine's form.\nSixteen years, kicked out in the cold,\nThese Kentucky hollers, stories untold.\nBroken arm, achin' bone and all,\nBut this rusted guitar, answered my call.\n(Bridge)\nFound solace in the strings, a mournful cry,\nEchoin' the pain I couldn't deny.\nEach note a whisper, a prayer sent high,\nTo the mountain's spirit, beneath the sky.\n(Chorus)\nOld man mountain, he don't speak a word,\nBut lessons learned, ain't never heard\nIn no dusty book or preacher's plea,\nJust the wind's sigh in the old oak tree.\nTruth ain't found in the city's glare,\nIt's here in the hollers, hangin' in the air.\n(Outro)\nYeah, hangin' in the air, like the mountain mist,\nA quiet knowin', that can't be missed.\nWhispers from the hemlock, soft and low,\nThe mountain's wisdom, helpin' me grow.\nHelpin' me grow...",
