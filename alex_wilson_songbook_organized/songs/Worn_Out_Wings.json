    "lyrics": "Verse 1 (Alex)\nCarved my name on a coal-dust road,\nHaulin’ dreams with a heavy load.\nEvery fall left a mark I can’t hide,\nSingin’ through storms where my hope nearly died.\n\nVerse 2 (Ashley)\nChased a light down a barroom haze,\nLost my heart in a thousand ways.\nScars tell tales of the fights I’ve braved,\nBut my voice still roars where the soul’s been saved.\n\nChorus (Both)\nWorn out wings, still flyin’ high,\nCarryin’ dreams ‘neath a broken sky.\nThrough the hurt, we’re holdin’ on tight,\nWorn out wings, soarin’ through the night!\n\nVerse 3 (Alex)\nYour song’s a river, cool on my pain,\nPulls me from shadows, breaks every chain.\nThat fire in your eyes, like a beacon’s call,\nLifts my battered heart when I’m bound to fall.\n\nVerse 4 (Ashley)\nYour truth cuts deep, like a whiskey’s burn,\nSteadies my soul when the tides all turn.\nBoy, your strength’s a mirror to my own,\nWe’re carved from the same unyieldin’ stone.\n\nChorus (Both)\nWorn out wings, still flyin’ high,\nCarryin’ dreams ‘neath a broken sky.\nThrough the hurt, we’re holdin’ on tight,\nWorn out wings, soarin’ through the night!\n\nBridge (Both, alternating)\n(Alex) Every crack’s a story we’ve lived to tell,\n(Ashley) Every scar’s a victory over hell.\n(Both) Side by side, we’re risin’ above,\nWorn out wings fueled by stubborn love!\n\nChorus (Both)\nWorn out wings, still flyin’ high,\nCarryin’ dreams ‘neath a broken sky.\nThrough the hurt, we’re holdin’ on tight,\nWorn out wings, soarin’ through the night!\n\nOutro (Both)\n(Claps, soft guitar fade)\nWorn out wings, we’ll never fall,\nTwo tough hearts answerin’ the call.",

    "soundsLike": "A polished country rock anthem duet opens with rich acoustic guitar, anchored by twangy electric riffs, Steady drums lock in with soulful pedal steel lines and warm organ swells, Layered harmonies and soaring, reverb-rich dual vocals amplify the chorus and drive a powerful, anthemic punch",
